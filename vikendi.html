              <p>An isolated Northern resort island in the shadow of Mount Kreznic, Vikendi was home to a wide variety of attractions, businesses and villages. Vikendi is enveloped in dense/thick forest and another aspect of the island is its warm Mediterranean coastline and snowy mountains in the central area of the map [3] [4]. Tourists can look to the future from the Cosomodrome, travel back to the past and walk with the giants at the prehistoric Dino Park, visit the aging Castle or even take a tour of the winery. Vikendi is as beautiful as it is dangerous and Survivors treading these bitter cold lands will have to watch their backs even more closely, as the fresh snow is perfect for leaving behind footprints! With snow and the footprints that you leave behind or other players leave behind, the hunter becomes the hunted. The days are long on Vikendi, but it wonâ€™t be long before the sun sets and the auroras fill the moonlit skies.<br><br>

          The map is inspired by Slovenia to create the visual design of the map .</p>
