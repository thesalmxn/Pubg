              <p>Miramar offers unique terrain and dense urban areas. With an island to the south east home to a prison and smaller villages, the entire area is cut off from the west and north-east by enormous canyons and mountains, with a looming metal wall to the north keeping outsiders out, and players in. Miramar will create a new Battle Royale experience where the old strategies from Erangel may no longer work and new tactics are required.<br><br>

              Miramar is the second playable map introduced PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. It is Mexican-themed with several points of interest.<br><br>

              Areas noted as high in popularity tend to have more player interactions, with the upside of containing higher quality equipment and potentially easier access to vehicles. Newer players may want to focus on areas that are low in popularity; though the equipment quality is lower, it allows them to adapt to the terrain and get a feel for the game.</p>
