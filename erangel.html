              <p>Erangel is the base map for the game. An 8x8 km map dotted with small outcroppings of buildings, the distance between major landmarks necessitates the use of vehicles to move between areas. As the game continues, the map area will be restricted to a smaller and smaller play area. A red circle will appear on the map from time to time, marking an area for offshore artillery to bombard. Erangel has varying weather, sometimes affecting visibility and requiring a change in tactics.<br><br>

              Cities and the local military base have plenty of decent loot, but you won't be the only one thinking the same thing. A mix of urban areas and wide open farmland create a wide variety of battles, ranging from intense close range firefights in streets and buildings, to long range sniping duels taking place across wheat fields.<br><br>

              The name Erangel was chosen, using PLAYERUNKNOWN's daughter's name, Eryn, as inspiration.</p>
